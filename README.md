# Mandelbrot
A Java program that displays the Mandelbrot set. Use arrow keys to move the camera, press Z and A to zoom in and out, and hold shift to make both of those controls do more.<br>
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers for which the following procedure does not go to infinity:<br>
<ul><li>Call the original number c; this value doesn't change</li>
  <li>Square the current value of the number and add c</li>
  <li>Repeat the square-and-adding procedure forever</li></ul>
The final image is color-coded by how many times it took for the procedure to start diverging, a measure of how close that point is to being part of the set.
